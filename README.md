# A*_Path_Finding_Algorithm_Visualizer


A Path Finding Visualizer for the A star path finding algorithm. 

A* Path Finding algorithm is one of the best path finding algorithm in my opinion mainly because of the completeness and the optimal efficiency. Although its space complexity is pretty high - O(b^d) as all the nodes generated are first stored in memory. Although this memory inefficiency is overpowered by algorithms that preprocess the entire graph to achieve the performance raises A* is still the best solution in many cases!

Over estimation of the heuristic can often be a problem and lead to bad solutions!

The Idea of Heuristic calculations and h score(f_score + g_score) is quite interesting and strong !
